I took this class because I wanted to use code to clean up and enhance my web pages.

I hope to learn what code is available, and how to properly use it to create killer webpages. 

The upload, as well as my avatar, are examples of some of my recent art projects. 
Noticing a few differences from the video, and trying to figure it all out. :) Yee-Haw :) lol
