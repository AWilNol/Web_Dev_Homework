        Happy

        It might seem crazy what I am 'bout to say
        Sunshine, she's here, you can take a break
        I'm a hot air balloon that could go to space
        With the air, like I don't care, baby by the way
        Huh <i>(Because I'm happy)</i>
        Clap along if you feel like a room without a roof
        <i>(Because I'm happy)</i>
        Clap along if you feel like happiness is the truth
        <i>(Because I'm happy)</i>
        Clap along if you know what happiness is to you
        <i>(Because I'm happy)</i>
        Clap along if you feel like that's what you wanna do
        Here come bad news talking this and that (Yeah)
        Well give me all you got, don't hold back (Yeah)
        Well I should probably warn you I'll be just fine (Yeah)
        No offense to you don't waste your time
        Here's why
        Clap along if you feel like a room without a roof
        <i>(Because I'm happy)</i>
        Clap along if you feel like happiness is the truth
        <i>(Because I'm happy)</i>
        Clap along if you know what happiness is to you
        <i>(Because I'm happy)</i>
        Clap along if you feel like that's what you wanna do
        Uh, bring me down
        Can't nothing, bring me down
        My level's too high to bring me down
        Can't nothing, bring me down, I said
        Bring me down, can't nothing
        Bring me down
        My level's too high to bring me down
        Can't nothing, bring me down, I said
        Clap along if you feel like a room without a roof
        <i>(Because I'm happy)</i>
        Clap along if you feel like happiness is the truth
        <i>(Because I'm happy)</i>
        Clap along if you know what happiness is to you
        <i>(Because I'm happy)</i>
        Clap along if you feel like that's what you wanna do
        <i>(Because I'm happy)</i>
        Clap along if you feel like a room without a roof
        <i>(Because I'm happy)</i>
        Clap along if you feel like happiness is the truth
        <i>(Because I'm happy)</i>
        Clap along if you know what happiness is to you
        <i>(Because I'm happy)</i>
        Clap along if you feel like that's what you wanna do
        Uh, bring me down (Happy, happy, happy, happy)
        Can't nothing (Happy, happy, happy, happy)
        Bring me down, my level's too high
        To bring me down (Happy, happy, happy, happy)
        Can't nothing (Happy, happy, happy, happy)
        Bring me down, I said
        Clap along if you feel like a room without a roof
        <i>(Because I'm happy)</i>
        Clap along if you feel like happiness is the truth
        <i>(Because I'm happy)</i>
        Clap along if you know what happiness is to you (ayy, ayy, ayy)
        <i>(Because I'm happy)</i>
        Clap along if you feel like that's what you wanna do
        <i>(Because I'm happy)</i>
        Clap along if you feel like a room without a roof
        <i>(Because I'm happy)</i>
        Clap along if you feel like happiness is the truth
        <i>(Because I'm happy)</i>
        Clap along if you know what happiness is to you (hey)
        <i>(Because I'm happy)</i>
        Clap along if you feel like that's what you wanna do
        <b>Come on</b>
