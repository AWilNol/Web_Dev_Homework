      <p>I was asked what my favorite song is, and it took awhile to decide. Yeah, you know why- so many choices! Do I choose a mood song? A song from a favorite bond or singer? The first song on my device? Or- and this is what I ended up doing when none of those felt right- do I choose the song that gets my body moving, my toes tappin', and makes me feel good each and every time I hear it because it brings a smile to my face?
