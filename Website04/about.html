      <p>Hello, and Welcome to Creative & Celtic!</p>

      <p>We began tinkering in 2020 due my husband, as he's the one started my love for wood. Well, all but the splinters, anyway! He taught me to do the spinning thing, and told me it had a name- a lathe. I very much like the lathe. Very free-flowing to create. He made lots of things, like tables and chairs. And we found the CNC machine, I'll leave you to look it up if you are interested, but it blew our imaginations open! So, we got one. Only, there was very little online to learn how to use one, so it was a shop weight for years.</p>

      <p>Then he got hurt at work, driving truck. His back injury prevented him from getting a job or caring fully for our child alone, and when it became very obvious his back injury perpetuated more areas that began to hurt him, we decided it was time to try working from home. The above logo is our first, designed by me, as with the art, and as we are artistic and we wood work, we again checked into the CNC machine. This time, we found resources, allowing him to slowly learn it. We decided the above logo would be for art, while the logo within the navigational panel is our woodworking logo, also created by me. I found a wolf, tribal, and while it was really cool, I decided I wanted a crack at it, and created the one on our logo. I could never find who made the first one, but I have wanted to thank them for the inspiration; so, thank you.</p>  

      <p>We began making little bowls, and posted them online. And our friends started wanting them. Along with trays, police and military plaques, wall deco, you name it. Then, Marty went to Summit in Stevensville, and several more people began wanting our creations; just by word of mouth, we were very busy! Then, we moved and things slowed down for awhile until we could make our transition work, and here we are! Ready to talk to you on a project you would like, whether for an occasion, or just because. All the best.</p>

      <p>&#169; 2023, Creative & Celtic</p>
