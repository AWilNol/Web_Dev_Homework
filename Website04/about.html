      <p>Hello, and Welcome to Creative & Celtic!</p>

      <p>We began tinkering in 2020 due my husband, as he's the one who started my love for wood. Well, all but the splinters, anyway! He taught me to do the spinning thing, and told me it had a name- a lathe. I very much like the lathe. Very free-flowing to create. He made lots of things, like tables and chairs. And we found the CNC machine. I'll leave you to look it up if you are interested, but it blew our imaginations open! So, we got one. As we found out quickly, there was very little online to learn how to use one, so it was a shop weight for years. He would woodwork, and I would write.</p>

      <p>Then he got hurt at work, driving truck. His back injury prevented him from getting a job or caring fully for our child alone, and when it became very obvious his back injury perpetuated more areas that began to hurt him, we decided it was time to try working from home. Hence Creative & Celtic. The above logo is our first, designed by me, as we again checked into the CNC machine. This time, we found resources, allowing him to slowly learn it, and as he learned more, his creations became more and more detailed, and more and more people didn't want to hand us back our creations. "Don't get quality like that!"</p> 

      <p>We decided my above logo would be for art, while my logo within the navigational panel is our woodworking logo. I found a tribal wolf drawing while surfing tattoo art, and while it was really cool, I decided I wanted a crack at it, and created the one on our logo. I could never find who made the first one, but I have wanted to thank them for the inspiration; so, thank you.</p>  

      <p>We began making little bowls, then bigger bowl, and posted them online. Our friends started wanting them. Along with trays, police and military plaques, wall deco, you name it. Then, Marty went to Summit in Stevensville, and several more people began wanting our creations; just by word of mouth, we were very busy! Then, we moved and things slowed down for awhile until we could make our transition work, and here we are! Ready to talk to you on a project you would like, whether for an occasion, or just because. All the best.</p>

      <p>&#169; 2023, Creative & Celtic</p>
