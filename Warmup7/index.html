                  ______________________________________________________________
     <p style="text-align:center">My books I'd fain cast off, I cannot read,<br>
       'Twixt every page my thoughts go stray at large<br>
       Down in the meadow, where is richer feed,<br>
       And will not mind to hit their proper targe.<br>
       Plutarch was good, and so was Homer too,<br>
       Our Shakespeare's life were rich to live again,<br>
       What Plutarch read, that was not good nor true,<br>
       Nor Shakespeare's books, unless his books were men.</p>

     <p style="text-align:center">Here while I lie beneath this walnut bough,<br>
       What care I for the Greeks or for Troy town,<br>
       If juster battles are enacted now<br>
       Between the ants upon this hummock's crown?</p>

     <p style="text-align:center">Bid Homer wait till I the issue learn,<br>
       If red or black the gods will favor most,<br>
       Or yonder Ajax will the phalanx turn,<br>
       Struggling to heave some rock against the host.</p>

     <p style="text-align:center">Tell Shakespeare to attend some leisure hour,<br>
       For now I've business with this drop of dew,<br>
       And see you not, the clouds prepare a shower--<br>
       I'll meet him shortly when the sky is blue.</p>

     <p style="text-align:center">This bed of herd's grass and wild oats was spread<br>
       Last year with nicer skill than monarchs use.<br>
       A clover tuft is pillow for my head,<br>
       And violets quite overtop my shoes.</p>

     <p style="text-align:center">And now the cordial clouds have shut all in,<br>
       And gently swells the wind to say all's well;<br>
       The scattered drops are falling fast and thin,<br>
       Some in the pool, some in the flower-bell.</p>

     <p style="text-align:center">I am well drenched upon my bed of oats;<br>
       But see that globe come rolling down its stem,<br>
       Now like a lonely planet there it floats,<br>
       And now it sinks into my garment's hem.</p>

     <p style="text-align:center">Drip drip the trees for all the country round,<br>
       And richness rare distills from every bough;<br>
       The wind alone it is makes every sound,<br>
       Shaking down crystals on the leaves below.</p>

     <p style="text-align:center">For shame the sun will never show himself,<br>
       Who could not with his beams e'er melt me so;<br>
       My dripping locks--they would become an elf,<br>
       Who in a beaded coat does gayly go.</p>
